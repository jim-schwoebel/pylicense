the following conditions: commercial research which is not directly 
associated with product development and has the primary purpose of 
publishing and sharing results with the academic world; pre-product

derivative works that are different from those provided by this license agreement. 
If you have created derivative works of the software, and distribute 
such derivative works, you will cause the modified files to carry

In return for the above rights, you agree to:

obtained herein) terminate automatically. Upon any such termination,
