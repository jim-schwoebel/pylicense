       This NeuroLex Research License Agreement (license, license agreement, 
       or agreement in the ongoing), is a legal agreement between you 
       and NeuroLex Laboratories, Inc. ('NeuroLex' or we) for the software 
       or data mentioned above, which may include source code, 
       and any associated materials, text or speech files, 
       associated media and "on-line" or electronic documentation 
       (all together called the "Software").  

       By installing, copying, or otherwise using this Software, 
       you agree to be bound by the terms in this license. 
       If you do not agree, you must not install copy or use the Software. 
       The Software is protected by copyright and other intellectual 
       property laws and is licensed, not sold.

       This license grants you the following rights:
       A. You may use, copy, reproduce, and distribute this Software 
          for any non-commercial purpose, subject to the restrictions 
          set out below. Some purposes which can be non-commercial are teaching, 
          academic research, public demonstrations and personal experimentation 
          or personal home use. You may also distribute this Software with 
          books or other teaching materials, or publish the Software on websites, 
          that are intended to teach the use of the Software for academic or 
          other non-commercial purposes. 
          You may NOT use or distribute this Software or any derivative works 
          in any form for commercial purposes, except those outlined in (B). 
          Examples of commercial purposes are running business operations, 
          licensing, leasing, or selling the Software, distributing the 
          Software for use with commercial products (no matter whether free or paid), 
          using the Software in the creation or use of commercial products or any 
          other activity which purpose is to procure a commercial gain to you or 
          others (except for conditions set out in (B)).
       B. Further, you may use the software for commercial research, which meets
          the following conditions: commercial research which is not directly
          associated with product development and has the primary purpose of 
          publishing and sharing results with the academic world; pre-product 
          evaluations of algorithms and methods, as long as these evaluations
          are more of an evaluatory, planning, and research nature than of a product development
          nature. 
          Any further commercial use requires you to obtain a commercial
          license or written approval from NeuroLex which grants
          you extended usage rights for this software. In particular any direct 
          (software) or indirect (models, features extracted with the software)
          use of the software, parts of the software, or derivatives in a 
          product (no matter whether free or paid), is not allowed without 
          an additional commercial license.
       C. If the software includes source code or data, you may create 
          derivative works of such portions of the software and distribute the 
          modified software for non-commercial purposes, as provided herein.
          If you distribute the software or any derivative works of the Software, 
          you must distribute them under the same terms and conditions as in this
          license, and you must not grant other rights to the software or 
          derivative works that are different from those provided by this 
          license agreement. 
          If you have created derivative works of the software, and distribute 
          such derivative works, you will cause the modified files to carry 
          prominent notices so that recipients know that they are not receiving 
          the original software. Such notices must state: 
          (i) that you have altered the software; 
          and (ii) the date of any changes as well as your name.

       In return for the above rights, you agree to:
       1. That you will not remove any copyright or other notices (authors 
          and citing information, for example) from the software.
       2. That if any of the software is in binary format, you will not attempt 
          to modify such portions of the software, or to reverse engineer or 
          decompile them, except and only to the extent authorized by applicable 
          law. 
       3. That the copyright holders (NeuroLex) are granted back, 
          without any restrictions or limitations, a non-exclusive, perpetual, 
          irrevocable, royalty-free, assignable and sub-licensable license, 
          to reproduce, publicly perform or display, install, use, modify, post, 
          distribute, make and have made, sell and transfer your modifications 
          to and/or derivative works of the software source code or data, 
          for any purpose.  
       4. That any feedback about the software provided by you to us is voluntarily 
          given, and NeuroLex shall be free to use the feedback 
          as they see fit without obligation or restriction of any kind, 
          even if the feedback is designated by you as confidential. 
          
       5. THAT THE SOFTWARE COMES "AS IS", WITH NO WARRANTIES. 
          THIS MEANS NO EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTY, INCLUDING 
          WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A 
          PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ANY WARRANTY AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR 
          ENJOYMENT OF THE SOFTWARE OR ANY WARRANTY OF TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.
          THERE IS NO WARRANTY THAT THIS SOFTWARE WILL FULFILL ANY OF YOUR 
          PARTICULAR PURPOSES OR NEEDS. ALSO, YOU MUST PASS THIS DISCLAIMER ON 
          WHENEVER YOU DISTRIBUTE THE SOFTWARE OR DERIVATIVE WORKS.

       6. THAT NEITHER NEUROLEX NOR ANY AUTHOR OR CONTRIBUTOR TO THE 
          SOFTWARE WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES RELATED TO THE SOFTWARE OR THIS 
          LICENSE, INCLUDING DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL 
          DAMAGES, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT THE LAW PERMITS, NO MATTER WHAT LEGAL 
          THEORY IT IS BASED ON. ALSO, YOU MUST PASS THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY 
          ON WHENEVER YOU DISTRIBUTE THE SOFTWARE OR DERIVATIVE WORKS.

       7. That we have no duty of reasonable care or lack of negligence, 
          and we are not obligated to (and will not) provide technical support for 
          the Software.
       8. That if you breach this license agreement or if you sue anyone over 
          patents that you think may apply to or read on the software or anyone's 
          use of the software, this license agreement (and your license and rights 
          obtained herein) terminate automatically. Upon any such termination, 
          you shall destroy all of your copies of the software immediately.  
          Sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10 and 11 of this license agreement shall survive 
          any termination of this license agreement.
       9. That the patent rights, if any, granted to you in this license agreement 
          only apply to the software, not to any derivative works you make.
       10.That the software may be subject to United States export or import laws or such 
          laws in other places. You agree to comply with all such laws and regulations 
          that may apply to the software after the delivery of the software to you.
       11.That all rights not expressly granted to you in this license agreement 
          are reserved by NeuroLex.
       12.That this license agreement shall be construed and controlled by the laws 
          of Delaware (United States of America), without regard to conflicts of law. 
          If any provision of this license agreement shall be deemed unenforceable 
          or contrary to law, the rest of this license agreement shall remain in 
          full effect and interpreted in an enforceable manner that most closely 
          captures the intent of the original language.
